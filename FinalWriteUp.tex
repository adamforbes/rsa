\section{History:}
\indent\indent
RSA is a public key encryption algorithm developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, 
and Leonard Adleman at MIT in 1977. Rivest and Shamir are both computer
scientists that were working on an ``unbreakable'' public key encryption method.
Rivest and Shamir worked on many different codes, and would pose them as a
challenge to Adleman. Forty two of these codes were presented, and Adleman broke
them all. Finally on attempty number 43, they created what is now known as the
RSA scheme. Incidentally, English Professor CLifford Cocks developed the exact
same encryption system in 1973, but it was classified as top-secret, so it was
not released until 1997. The RSA algorithm was released for public domain in
1997.\\\indent
The algorithm operates by using two distinct, large prime numbers to generate
public and private keys. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but
only someone with the private key can decrypt it. The algorithm is hard to
break, because if the prime numbers are large enough, the factorization is
exponential in time.

\section{Original Ideas:}

\section{Algorithm Implementation:}
For our implementation, we chose JavaScript as our environment because of its
ease for web development. We really wanted to end up with something that we
could show off and display in a public setting. The code to the implementation
of our RSA algorithm can be found in Appendix A. For our implementation, we
relied heavily on the BigInt library found here: 
http://leemon.com/crypto/BigInt.js.
While there were other BigInt libraries, out there but this is the one that had
all of the functions we needed, and was implemented in an easy format for us to
deal with. The main functions we used from this library were \ty{str2bigInt}
which takes a string and a base that represents the big integer and converts it
for us. We also used \ty{inverseMod} which takes a big integer and a modulus as
a big integer, and returns the big integer that is the inverse if one 

\section{Data Collection:}
Any analysis of RSA certificates requires a set of data with which to test. For our project we needed a large set of data so as to best mimic the data that Lenstra
et al used in their analysis of public keys. Lenstra et al stated in their paper that they used the Electronic Frontier Foundation's SSL Observatory - https://www.eff.org/observatory. We initially looked at the SSL Observatory as a possibly source of data for our project. However, unfortunately the SSL Observatory has not been updated in a few years. Furthermore, it includes no complete guide on how to use its source, and is simply a collection of python scripts that interact with a MySQL database in distinct ways. Thus, we were unable to successfully use the SSL Observatory source code as a means to gather RSA public keys. However, there exists data dumps from the SSL Observatory from 2010. We gathered this data, available through bittorrent, and used it as a starting point.

In order to see the effectiveness and change since the Lenstra paper was published in early 2012 we needed to scrap for fresh data. (The paper briefly mentions that they latest data they looked at was from February 2012.)
