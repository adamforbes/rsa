\section{Data Collection:}
Any analysis of RSA certificates requires a set of data with which to test. For our project we needed a large set of data so as to best mimic the data that Lenstra
et al used in their analysis of public keys. Lenstra et al stated in their paper that they used the Electronic Frontier Foundation's SSL Observatory - https://www.eff.org/observatory. We initially looked at the SSL Observatory as a possibly source of data for our project. However, unfortunately the SSL Observatory has not been updated in a few years. Furthermore, it includes no complete guide on how to use its source, and is simply a collection of python scripts that interact with a MySQL database in distinct ways. Thus, we were unable to successfully use the SSL Observatory source code as a means to gather RSA public keys. However, there exists data dumps from the SSL Observatory from 2010. We gathered this data, available through bittorrent, and used it as a starting point.

In order to see the effectiveness and change since the Lenstra paper was published in early 2012 we needed to scrap for fresh data. (The paper briefly mentions that the latest data they looked at was from February 2012.) The SSL Observatory scans all IPv4 space for servers that respond to https requests. We did not have the computational time/power to do this, so we decided on the Alexa top 1 million domains as a source of hosts. Then for each one of these domains we attempted to connect via HTTPS and collect the public key used for the connection. The specific method of collecting these moduli was the  This was done by curl'ing the domain at port 443 with a HTTP request. If we received a response, we used \ty{openssl s_client} to get the decoded certificate and \ty{$openssl x509} to decode the certificate into a easily passable format.  However, we noticed that less than 10\% of domains responded to our requests. We added some further error handling for these situations. We followed redirects and tried a few common subdomains to improve our rate of responses to over 12\%. Out of the 1000000 domains we received 125723 X.509 certificates each containing a moduli. This was the source of our data for our experiments.
